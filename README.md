I work with agricultural and environmental research data.
In the past month at work I've been processing wheat plants, analyzing precipitation data, and screening data.
To keep organized, I write a to-do list, have organized folders, and document what I do each day.

What do you tell poeple about your field of study at a party? I study Marketing and Data Science because I think its pretty cool to bea ble to piece together options or solutions with data.

In the past month, what are the three main activities you have been doing? In the past month I have spent a lot of time gaming on my pc, working at Kingland as an intern, and Prepping by gaining some basic knowledge for some of my classes like my Spreadsheet analytics course.

What are the three most important tools or strategies you use for organizing your work. I like to think of the larger picture but I tend to use the "day by day" strategy when thigns get to hectic and just figure out a set amount of work I need to get done ach day. I have used excel in the past to organize things for classes, like grade estimates. I prefer to have a direction with my work but do not like strict plans in general.
